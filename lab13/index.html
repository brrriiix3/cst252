		<h1>Lab 13: Basic Debugging</h1>
		<p> For this lab we are using our debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> The challenge I had when completing this assignment was going through each lab to look for errors.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>I added a screenshot of Lab 2 before I fixed it<p>

			<section id="debugging">
				<p>The main issue Lab 2 had is that the CSS did not match my newer labs so I updated it.</p>

				<br>
				<p>Other than fixing some styling issues or applying my css to older pages
					 I had some minor issues when going back to labs. I had submitted all labs
					 to this point and the one I was stuck on before I have already gone back and fixed.
					 Which ended up me having a spelling error. I did test the way the debugger works
					 and found that quite useful. I do practice the "Rubber Ducking" method when I
					 get stuck or I am working with my partner. </p>
